- inference server works
- asr tts has issues
- whisper cpp python not very good in test for some reason

- separate tests:
    - conversation history redis tested
    - ms-markitdown tested
    - groq inference teste
    - google deeper research agenet tested
    - maps tool tested (basic), embeding not working (have to use maps javascript api)

- will use phi4 multimodal for asr, chat completion and if possible, for tts - replacing inference server... (create server)
